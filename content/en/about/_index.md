## Opportunity

### What is happening ?

End Users are struggling with their Cloud Native Journeys. There is no clear/failure-proof framework to follow when executing a “cloud native” architecture using CNCF projects and tools.

### Why is it happening ?

End Users report that the range of options in the cloud-native landscape is vast and can be confusing.

### What is the impact of this problem ?

End Users report that this leads to a perception of complexity and impedes adoption.



## Scope 

The End User Technical Advisory Board (TAB) established this working group to propose solutions to the problem outlined above as part of its charter commitments. This draft proposal is currently quite high-level as it is intended as the starting point on which we can iterate. The minimum viable product with which we can address the problem statement above is publishing one or more specific architectures that have been demonstrated in production environments. Any proposed solution should not go too far beyond that in this iteration.


## Proposed solution

We propose to publish:
* A CNCF-aligned website establishing a high-level reference architecture, or set of them, without referring to specific projects;
* A template “user success story” through which end users can submit their more 	specific architectures, which will refer to specific projects and will only be published once a sufficient diversity of CNCF projects are represented, and then with clear branding to show separation from CNCF;
   * User success stories may contain organizational as well as technical 	journeys where an architecture inspired a positive organizational change.
   * User success stories may contain non CNCF and commercial products as part of their stack such that they reflect reality (see risks and 		mitigation for more discussion).
 The template will include a standard, perhaps C4, for technical diagrams to  ensure consistency in publication.
 We must show a clear value proposition for the end users themselves in publishing these.
* A list of end users who are open to discussing their successful architectures with 	others, with CNCF managing the contact between them and interested parties to prevent vexatious contacts.

Much as organizations sometimes struggle to start building cloud applications in the absence of examples, so too will they struggle with the success stories. Accordingly, CNCF and end users on the TAB should endeavor to supply their own success stories before we invite others to do so. First such successful story comes from AllianzDirect and Adobe and it contains, as requested in our last TAB conversation, both a STATE(alive ideally) and a JOURNEY(see chapter Success Stories at the end of this document).
Additionally, any production should be preceded by some kind of lightweight user survey to ensure we’re solving the right problem in the right way.
